//Welcome to the Arduino Nano Pin tester
/** 
The Arduino Nano is a development board designed and manufactured by the 
Arduino Team in Italy. The board is used for prototyping small scale projects
that require little computing power.



What's on the board
1  I/O Pinheaders "those black things you see with holes in them on the board"
2  USB Serial Connector
3  ISP Pinpout " Insystem Programming"
4  Power State LED
5  Receive LED
7  Transmit LED
8  Reset Button
9  Microcontroller "Atmega 328P"
10 A few resistors
11 Capacitors
12 Automatic Voltage Regulator


What you need to Test your Arduino Nano Board
*An Arduino Nano Board
*A USB Cable
*Jumper Wires "Male to Male"
*A Breadboard
*An LED "any color" 3.3v/5v Norminal
*A Computer / PC / Desktop,

  // put your setup code here, to run once:
for(i=0;i<=13;i++){pinMode(i,OUTPUT);}
}


void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
while(5<6)
for(i=0;i<=13;i++){
  digitalWrite(i,HIGH);
